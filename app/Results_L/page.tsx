            <ul>ðŸª’ As your beard gets longer, it's important to keep it clean to avoid any skin irritation or infection. Wash your beard regularly with a mild <a href = "https://thebeardclub.com/products/beard-shampoo"> Shampoo. </a></ul>
            <ul>ðŸª’ Just like with a shorter beard, growing a long beard takes time and patience. It may take several months before you see significant growth, so don't give up too soon.</ul>

            <ul>ðŸª’ Don't use any old comb lying around your house. Your beard deserves better. Look for a <a href = "https://evanalexandergrooming.com/products/wooden-beard-comb-red-sandalwood?variant=12125823533146&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=CjwKCAjw5dqgBhBNEiwA7PryaNHGEBh1Z1ITJodf1VU6vxnkGrWtnrOEzZucQXxD70v3_xYM_ZrkFxoCzoAQAvD_BwE">Comb</a>, with teeth as wide as a lumberjack's smile.</ul>
